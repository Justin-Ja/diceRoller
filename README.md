# Dice Roller

## Description
A GUI program that allows the user to roll multiple dice at once, giving a total and showing all values rolled


## Running the Program 
To run the program, run the main file in python:

```
python3 main.py
```

If it fails to launch, you may not have TKinter (the GUI manager/package) installed.
On Linux you can run the following:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### Additional Notes:

This was intended to be a quick project to brush up on Python, but I may add some other features in the future if I do come back to this for any reason
