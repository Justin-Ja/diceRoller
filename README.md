# Dice Roller

## Description
A GUI program that allows the user to roll multiple dice at once, giving a total and showing all values rolled


## Running the Program 
To run the program, run the main file in python:

```
python3 main.py
```

If it fails to launch, you may not have TKinter (the GUI manager/package) installed.
On Linux you can run the following:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk

### Main Issues/TODOS:

Display: Make the app look better

RNG: Overhaul into a class, add some form of type checking or error handling.
